Recidiviz is a fast moving team focused on arming corrections agencies with the data that they need to quickly reduce incarceration in the US criminal justice system. When we find a solution that works, we scale it – quickly. We are now reaching 1 in 4 people in prison in the US. In 2023, we're focused on deepening our impact in each of our 11 partner states, expanding to new states, and growing the team. That's where you come in.




In this role, you'll work closely with the CEO and Chief of Staff to make the whole operation run as smoothly and effectively as possible. You'll get exposure to every part of the organization — product and design, engineering and data science, finance, comms, and people operations. You'll support the CEO's wild travel schedule, handle expenses and calendaring, support our two offices and remote staff, and generally help maximize every opportunity for a smoother, more impactful organization. You'll spot gaps, find solutions, and pinch hit where needed. This is a fast-faced, broad role that's great for someone who wants to help grow an organization from 50 to 100 people and maximize impact every step of the way.




A year from now, you will know Recidiviz inside and out, will fully own scheduling, travel, and coordination for the CEO and will be supporting the operations of two offices and our remote team as the company grows from 50 people to 100.




You'll also work with the CEO and Chief of Staff to identify one or more growth areas for yourself: there are endless possibilities here — go deep on ghostwriting, own the planning and execution of team gatherings, find cross-team efficiencies by coordinating travel across the team or by spotting other org-wide opportunities, dive deeper into strategy, finance, or team/culture, etc.




Core Responsibilities




This role is entrepreneurial — previous administrative experience is awesome, but not required. Proactivity, detail-orientation, curiosity, and collaboration are crucial.




Admin

Expertly handle calendar on behalf of the CEO, optimize her workflow to create efficiencies

Manage the inbox, triage emails, and ghostwrite on her behalf

Sit in team meetings, take notes, address action items

Coordinate complex travel arrangements, handle expenses (and travel occasionally!)

Strategy

Learn about all parts of the organization (product, engineering, data science, comms, finance, legal, people operations) and spot gaps

Partner closely with the CEO and Chief of Staff on special projects as they arise (e.g. spearhead projects that help connect the dots between teams, reduce repetitive work, and position Recidiviz for scale

Work with Chief of Staff to understand and act on strategic priorities

Team

Assist with new employee onboarding

Organize and run yearly company retreats

Run the New York City and San Francisco offices coordinating equipment, snacks, office events and speakers

Coordinate events and maintain team culture across an in-person and remote team

Qualifications




You're passionate about our mission to dramatically reduce incarceration in ways that are safe and equitable, and you're excited to work in a startup environment where you'll have a lot of ownership in making that mission a reality.

You live and breathe organization. You bring order to chaos by being thorough and systematic. You get energized by creating and maintaining systems.

You always dot your i's and cross your t's. You thrive in the details. In your work, you leave no stone unturned. You maintain a high bar of polish for the work that crosses your desk.




Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application.




Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look. You might be right for another role and/or another time.

Recidiviz is a fast moving team focused on arming corrections agencies with the data that they need to quickly reduce incarceration in the US criminal justice system. When we find a solution that works, we scale it – quickly. We are now reaching 1 in 4 people in prison in the US. In 2023, we're focused on deepening our impact in each of our 11 partner states, expanding to new states, and growing the team. That's where you come in.




In this role, you'll work closely with the CEO and Chief of Staff to make the whole operation run as smoothly and effectively as possible. You'll get exposure to every part of the organization — product and design, engineering and data science, finance, comms, and people operations. You'll support the CEO's wild travel schedule, handle expenses and calendaring, support our two offices and remote staff, and generally help maximize every opportunity for a smoother, more impactful organization. You'll spot gaps, find solutions, and pinch hit where needed. This is a fast-faced, broad role that's great for someone who wants to help grow an organization from 50 to 100 people and maximize impact every step of the way.




A year from now, you will know Recidiviz inside and out, will fully own scheduling, travel, and coordination for the CEO and will be supporting the operations of two offices and our remote team as the company grows from 50 people to 100.




You'll also work with the CEO and Chief of Staff to identify one or more growth areas for yourself: there are endless possibilities here — go deep on ghostwriting, own the planning and execution of team gatherings, find cross-team efficiencies by coordinating travel across the team or by spotting other org-wide opportunities, dive deeper into strategy, finance, or team/culture, etc.




Core Responsibilities




This role is entrepreneurial — previous administrative experience is awesome, but not required. Proactivity, detail-orientation, curiosity, and collaboration are crucial.




Admin

Expertly handle calendar on behalf of the CEO, optimize her workflow to create efficiencies

Manage the inbox, triage emails, and ghostwrite on her behalf

Sit in team meetings, take notes, address action items

Coordinate complex travel arrangements, handle expenses (and travel occasionally!)

Strategy

Learn about all parts of the organization (product, engineering, data science, comms, finance, legal, people operations) and spot gaps

Partner closely with the CEO and Chief of Staff on special projects as they arise (e.g. spearhead projects that help connect the dots between teams, reduce repetitive work, and position Recidiviz for scale

Work with Chief of Staff to understand and act on strategic priorities

Team

Assist with new employee onboarding

Organize and run yearly company retreats

Run the New York City and San Francisco offices coordinating equipment, snacks, office events and speakers

Coordinate events and maintain team culture across an in-person and remote team

Qualifications




You're passionate about our mission to dramatically reduce incarceration in ways that are safe and equitable, and you're excited to work in a startup environment where you'll have a lot of ownership in making that mission a reality.

You live and breathe organization. You bring order to chaos by being thorough and systematic. You get energized by creating and maintaining systems.

You always dot your i's and cross your t's. You thrive in the details. In your work, you leave no stone unturned. You maintain a high bar of polish for the work that crosses your desk.




Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application.




Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look. You might be right for another role and/or another time.
