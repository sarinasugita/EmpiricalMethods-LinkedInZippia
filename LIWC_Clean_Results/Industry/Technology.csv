Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart

See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)

Execution Is Binary

We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.

We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.

Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done”.

Missionaries, Not Mercenaries

We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.

We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.

We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.

Inputs > Outcomes

We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.

We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.

We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.

We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.

Honesty Over Harmony

We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.

We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.

We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it.

We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.

Invent & Iterate

We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done”, and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders.

We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.

We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.

28,Analyst,"Technology, Information and Internet","FIRM OVERVIEW:

Blue Collective (‘Blue’ for short) is an investment firm located in Brooklyn, New York. We are Venture Capital and Private Equity investors with a simple, overall thesis – we believe that phenomenal people build phenomenal businesses.

We seek out, invest in, and support phenomenal people wherever and whoever they may be. This often means extra work for us because truly exceptional people are often ‘off-the-radar’ – over-looked and under-valued by average investors. We put in the extra work because it matters. We currently have over 60 portfolio companies and more than $130 million under management. We have generated benchmark-busting returns for our investors and have contributed (in a small way) to the success of a lot of phenomenal people and phenomenal businesses.

We are a small and growing team with a big vision. We are building a different kind of investment firm – one that generates amazing investment returns from an unyielding commitment to finding and supporting great people that others pass over. Our vision requires us to be always approachable, always independent, and always values-driven. We are looking for individuals to join our team who are excited by this vision.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

You will contribute to activities across the full spectrum of Blue operations, including sourcing, diligence, portfolio support, investor engagement, and brand-building.

Summer Interns will also be considered for our longer-term Scouts program at the end of summer. Scouts have the opportunity to continue to work with Blue beyond the summer, while at school or after. Scouts support primarily on sourcing, diligence, and brand-building while continuing to receive formal coaching and mentorship. Scouts also receive equity and are priority candidates for us when we hire for full-time positions.

A current student pursuing a BS, BA, MBA, or other advanced degree with at least a 3.5 GPA (...the intern role is for people currently at school - our full-time roles for people not in school)
Exceptional written and verbal communication skills (...investing is story-telling at its core and clear comms mean clear thinking)
Superb analytical and reasoning skills (...thinking logically and creatively is the most important skillset for an investor)
Comfortable and adept with numbers (...you don't need to be a math whiz, but you also can't be scared of numbers)
Extreme attention to detail and ability to manage multiple deadlines at once (...working with us is like 'drinking from a fire-hose' so if you love big 'to do' lists, then you've got the basics already locked down)
Values-driven with the highest levels of professional and personal integrity (...at the end of the day, our reputation is our most important asset and so your character inside and outside the office matters A LOT to us)

Climb Hire’s mission is to create economic opportunity and mobility.

We train and prepare diverse and determined working adults earning below the livable wage for entry-level jobs in corporate America via four distinct learning tracks: Salesforce Administrator, Customer Experience, Google Project Management, and Financial Services with Fidelity. Most Climbers are between the ages of 22 and 40 and the majority do not hold four-year degrees. We’re not just a class, we’re a community. Relationship-building is at the core of our model, since we know that 9 out of 10 job seekers land roles through warm connections versus applying cold. Our community is built on “paying it forward”: we forge a network of peers and alumni who empower each other in every way, through job referrals and emotional and intellectual support.

80% of our first and second cohorts secured jobs that increased their income 2-3x. Climbers gain, on average, $40k in their new roles.

Climb Hire is a national organization and we work remotely. We are expanding rapidly across the country and are poised to grow by 3-10x in the next two years.

Who We're Looking For

We’re looking for a motivated and ambitious Corporate Engagement executive to join our growing Partnerships team! The Director of Corporate Engagement will become a trusted resource in identifying and engaging key employers with the goal of expanding our corporate partner base by 5x. According to LinkedIn, job seekers are 9x more likely to get a job versus applying cold. Climb Hire was born out of this idea. We know that who you know matters just as much (if not more) as what you know. This is why we're set on building not only a strong network of corporate hiring partners but also fostering key social capital relationships among corporate professionals and our Climb Hire alumni so they can continue referring each other into great jobs as we scale. With this blended model of corporate and alumni engagement, we aim to scale our volunteer base to 1000+ individuals this year and nurture an alumni referral network that will help us continue our track record of excellent job placement (over 80% get jobs within 12 months of graduation, 30% above industry standard).

This is a remote position. We want a self-motivated, driven, and highly collaborative individual that can contribute to our growth, work in a dynamic environment, and work proactively to drive overall sales and partnership strategy. You will have the opportunity to be professionally developed by our experienced sales and employer partnerships team. The compensation range for this role is $110,000-$150,000k annually depending on experience.

Responsibilities

Prospect, develop, and qualify employer partner leads (ranging from small startups to the Fortune 500) with the goal of engaging them in partnerships that range from volunteering/mentorship opportunities to hiring commitments (the ultimate goal)

Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart

See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)

Execution Is Binary

We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.

We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.

Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done”.

Missionaries, Not Mercenaries

We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.

We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.

We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.

Inputs > Outcomes

We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.

We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.

We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.

We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.

Honesty Over Harmony

We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.

We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.

We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it.

We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.

Invent & Iterate

We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done”, and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders.

We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.

We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
