About Freymiller

For over 45 years, the Freymiller family has worked to earn a reputation for professionalism, integrity and excellence in the transportation industry. Our founder, Don Freymiller, grew up on a Wisconsin dairy farm. In 1968, he bought his first truck in an effort to better provide for his young family. By 1980, Freymiller Trucking boasted 56 trucks and was exclusively devoted to hauling temperature-controlled freight. Today, we are still family-owned and operated, and now a second Freymiller generation has joined in our rich tradition of going the extra mile to keep every customer satisfied.
