The Shipyard is currently seeking candidates to fill several summer internship positions across all offices (Columbus, OH, Sacramento, CA, and San Diego, CA).

While the internship is for a semester (3-6 months), some have established a career at The Shipyard. Creative and curious students interested in marketing, advertising, communications, project management, or data analytics are encouraged to apply through our careers page.

What To Expect

Summer interns will get an overview of each department and will have the opportunity to shadow various meetings and workings sessions, partnering with team members on tasks and assignments allowing them to contribute to the overall project/campaign.

Each student will be dedicated to a specific department/function and assigned a supervisor to provide general guidance and mentorship while learning about the agency and how we work cross-functionality, having an opportunity to explore and learn about all pieces within an advertising agency.

At the end of the program, each intern will put together a presentation providing an overview of their experience and key insights they have gained regarding a career in marketing.

We truly believe that a hands-on learning approach is essential to the success of our interns, therefore, we require candidates to be able to work on-site in our Columbus office.

The expectation is that each student will work approximately 20-25 hours per week. The internship will take place over the duration of the summer. Students will be compensated $16-18 per hour for their participation in this program.
